Project Overview
The User Authentication Service project is designed to provide basic authentication functionalities for a web application. It includes features such as user registration, password hashing, and basic session management. The project is built using Flask for the web framework and SQLAlchemy for database management.

Features
User Registration: Allows users to sign up with an email and password.
Password Hashing: Securely stores passwords using bcrypt hashing.
Session Management: Handles user login and session tracking.
JSON API: All interactions with the service are done via RESTful API endpoints returning JSON responses.
